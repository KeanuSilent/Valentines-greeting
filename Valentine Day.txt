<p>Your boyfriend truly misses your companionship as you are my soulmate.</p>

<p>I am thankful that God has allowed our paths to cross and blessed me to have you in my life.<p>

<p>I know today we cannot spend time together but we are always connected as you have my heart and I have yours.<p>

<p>I Love you Heike Meyer and you will be my one and only Valentine forever<p>
